# [Memory Game](https://crystal-dawn.github.io/udacity-fend-memory-game-resources/)

## Overview
This is a collection of resources that were shared over Slack during the 2018 Grow with Google Scholarship for the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree Program.

## Contribution
Sharing is caring! This repo wouldn't be possible without students. Don't be shy to keep the collection growing! Please make sure to categorize each resource under the respective rubric requirement.

**_Note_**: This has been created with techniques taught in the classroom leading up to the Memory Game project. In effort to ensure all students can contribute, it will not be refactored with advanced techniques. Contributions should be made by adding the resource information to the object.
